# Analysis Notebooks

## Analysis done in Python

The notebook [CFR.ipynb](./CFR.ipynb) replicates several of the original
analyses in
[Racial and ethnic disparities in the observed COVID-19 case fatality rate among the U.S. population](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.annepidem.2022.07.010)
using only Python/Pandas (i.e., without use of Stata). These include Table 1
(CFRs), Figure 1 which plots the CFR by month and ethnic group, and Figure 3
which plots state-specific CFRs, separately by age group and racial and ethnic
group.

The file [table.py](./table.py) contains methods for generating tables in
Doxygen flavored Markdown.
